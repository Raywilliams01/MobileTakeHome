### Summary: Include screen shots or a video of your app highlighting its features

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
Refactored the APIService.
Create a protocal so I can mock the api request and change the return value base off the endpoint, which is pass a param.


### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
Not Sure how much time was spend, but I guess 2 days. 
I focus almost all of my time on creating reusable, clean code that anyone can modify. 
If I had a design, I would match the design.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?

The big trade off I made was do I want to make a really pretty app or loose coupling app 
I was not sure which one would be more impressive. Also, creating the cache. For example, a choice a file base system or in memory. 

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
My Weakest part of the project was the unit test. I could have added more tests. 
Second, making the app super pretty I prefer to follow a design than create a design from my mind.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.

I would like to apologize for taking so long to return this project.
I was sick for a few days. I was a React Native developer who is trying to make the switch to iOS. 
I recently completed a course on Udacity for iOS development. I am a hands-on quick learner and great team member. 
I have a great understanding of async calls thanks to JavaScript and a great understanding of 
how we should handle network requests and respond to unexpected issues.
